## Objective

To draw an sketch for a dashboard for Laboratoria while considering the following: 

The dashboard is a tool used by teachers, training managers, directors and managers of Labotaria to quickly see what's happening in the classroom. In the dashboard, these users can access quickly in real time to stadistics and data such as:

1. Number of registered students
2. Number of deserted students
3. Number and percentage of students who pass the minimum evaluation grade
4. Average grade per Sprint
5. Average Soft Skills grade
6. Average Technical Skills grade

Moreover, Laboratoria has several graduates generations, normally having 2 generations each year starting from 2014 and operating in 4 sites (Arequipa, Mexico City, Lima, Santiago de Chile). User may want to access data of sites and previous generations to make comparisons.

## Outcome

This Sketch was used for testing with Institute's teachers and training managers. The outcome was that the users stated that the information was clear and graphics with colours helped to identify quickly students' information. They also didn't have any problems for navigating through the site, which shows the usability of the prototype.
